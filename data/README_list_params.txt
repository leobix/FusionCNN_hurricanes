The list of the parameters are the ones available on the ERAInterm database. The new ERA5 database might have new parameters, but also more levels.

These lists were made manually in order to run the codes automatically, based on the ecmwf ERAInterm website (see for ex. https://apps.ecmwf.int/archive-catalogue/?stream=oper&levtype=sfc&expver=1&month=jan&year=1979&type=an&class=ei )

The lists of levels represent the available atmospheric levels for the different type of data. (sfc is surface data, pl is pressure levels). See here for more details: https://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/elibrary/2011/8174-era-interim-archive-version-20.pdf

For the parameters, I used mostly this page: https://apps.ecmwf.int/codes/grib/param-db
